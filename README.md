# Overview
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a text adventure story with reactive elements. Included here is the core functionality for
initiating "encounters" and determining outcomes based on correct input from the player while on a time limit. Functionality inside
includes a code-side ajustable timer to change the speed of reactive events with the intended progression to involve non-hostile interactions
as varried entities within those interactions.
